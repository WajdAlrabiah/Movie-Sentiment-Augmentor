# Movie-Sentiment-Augmentor
A sentiment analysis project for movie reviews that enhances data quality through back-translation augmentation using MarianMT models. The project explores multiple text representation techniques — Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec — and evaluates their performance using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers.
