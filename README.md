# Movie-Sentiment-Augmentor
A sentiment analysis project for movie reviews that enhances data quality through back-translation augmentation using MarianMT models.
The project explores multiple text representation techniques — Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec — and evaluates their performance using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers.
It includes detailed preprocessing, data visualization, translation-based augmentation, and model accuracy evaluation for improved sentiment classification.

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.
