0,"Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naأ¯ve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes آ– from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes آ– ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents.",positive
1,"Yes you read that correctly.Finding Nemo had brilliant, breathtaking underwater scenes that blow your mind!! Characters that you connect with, that have emotion, style and humour. The soundtrack is perfect to boot. Honestly what more could you ask for? In glorious 4K HDR with vibrant Dolby Atmos it gives this iconic classic a whole new life!!",positive
2,"I didn't see this movie until it came out on DVD. My family and I don't go to the movies very often, mostly because there's hardly anything worth seeing.But this movie was absolutely flawless. The voice cast was super. The voice of Nemo is Alexander Gould, who is 11 years old now. I saw his picture, and I really like his smile.""Finding Nemo"" is a classic. It'a among my favorite movies, and is a movie everyone should see. Unlike about 96% of movies, this movie is Rated ""G"", and can be viewed by children. There might be a few moments when it gets ""scary,"" but they soon turn into comedy.Watch ""Finding Nemo"" and I think you'll be a happier person by the end of the movie!My Score: 10/10.",positive
3,"Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named ""Shark Bait"". He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react. The animators have done their homework for this picture.This movie is quite an experience. It is a film the whole family can enjoy for years to come. It is a timeless adventure that people can enjoy. Don't let this film drift out to sea...",positive
4,"Never, and I mean, never, in my entire life, has a movie effect me the same way Finding Nemo did. It's the best movie I've EVER seen, and I know I say that about alot movie, but I actually mean it this time. Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would.",positive

7,"As charming as it is beautiful, Andrew Stanton (and co-director Lee Unkrich)'s 'Finding Nemo' is a joy, both visually and cinematically. It is a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that warms your heart from time to time. The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is excellence and beauty in every frame. Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable. All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. A delight from start to finish.",positive
8,"""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.",positive
9,"Pixar has made some of the enjoyable films in the past years: The Toy Story films, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life to name a few. What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in ""Finding Nemo"" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlin's parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whale's mouth.As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.",positive
10,"My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail. I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it clichأ©, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.Rating: ***** out of 5.",positive
11,"I am not an Animation fan and always just avoid watching it.But after watching this, I fall in love with animated movies.It was quite interesting seeing fishes
daily life though I know it's not real but somehow I am just mesmerised by it.I never think about what fishes do, do they study,do they really live in fear,who oppress them bla bla. And how the father find it's son was quite interesting. The aquarium incident leaves me really believe tbat do they really did that in real lifeًں¤£",positive
12,"If Walt Disney was alive today, he would be proud of Michael Eisner. Building an alliance with Pixar and distributing Pixar's genius speaks well of the good chairman.I guess I was not surprised that(at the advanced screening of the new Pixar/Disney flix,) ""Finding Nemo"" would be brilliant. Entertaining my 5 1/2 year old child, my wife and I, ""Nemo"" made for a great family event. Yes, my son will make sure I pay for a second showing... and you know, I will gladly do so.I guess, all tolled, this animated movie should make $250 million easy. Perhaps $300 million... Okay, let's go for it! $366 million.Enjoy.",positive
13,"""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish named Marlin losing his son Nemo. This movie is about friendship and how friends can help you accomplish the hardest things in life. ""Finding Nemo"" is story written and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2003. Finding Nemo is about a clown fish named Marlin looking for his captured son Nemo. In this journey, Marlin meets a blue tang fish named Dory. Dory is a fish that is suffering from memory loss, but she helps Marlin find Nemo. Both Marlin and Dory face great danger, and hard situations in this journey. Meanwhile, Nemo is trying really hard to find a way to get out of the dentist's fish tank and find his way to the open sea in search of his father. But it's not that easy when you have Darla the fish killer (the little girl with the braces). ""Finding Nemo"" is a great Animated Movie. The movie uses amazing shades and colors, great sound effects, and amazing camera angles. In the scene where the diver pops up in front of the screen is amazingly realistic, it makes the audience feel like they are the ones in the movie. It also makes the audience feel like they are the clown fish when a huge human face pops up in front of the camera; the audience would feel small and also panic like Nemo. The director of the movie (Andrew Stanton) did an amazingly great job at animating the movie and adding scenes that will make the audience feel what the characters are feeling.The theme of the movie is there throughout the whole movie, but the audience realizes it near the end of the movie. The theme of the movie is friendship, and Marlin was able to accomplish his goal when Dory helped him through all the danger they faced. Another place friendship was used was when Nemo was captured in the fish tank in the doctor's office, where Nemo's friends saved his life from getting flushed down the toilet.""Finding Nemo"" is one of the BEST animated movies Pixar Animation Studios made. I strongly recommend for everyone to watch this movie. This movie would make you feel like you are in the movie and not watching the movie.10/10",positive
14,"Pixar has done it again! That is a phrase we have become accustomed to hearing these past few years. Pixar Animation Studios has taken the children's movie industry by storm. Andrew Stanton takes us head first into the beautiful, strangely bewildering, world of the big blue ocean with Finding Nemo. We expected children to be captivated by this new installment of children's animation, but parents are also catching the wave as well. This isn't just some fish tale! Okay, well maybe it is. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a paranoid, highly overprotective clown fish. His son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is a young child full of energy, enthusiasm, with a dash a rebellion thrown in there. Nemo was left crippled at birth after an attack that took his mother and all of his siblings. This leaves NEmo with a deep desire to be independent. This is shown while on a school field trip. Nemo, trying to show off to some friends swims out into open waters. A pair of divers come from the darkness and kidnap Nemo. Marlin, with the help a newly found and hilariously forgetful friend Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) start the adventure to save the only thing that he has left in this world. Little did they know Marlin and Dory will run into all sorts of roadblocks along the way. They encounter sharks that have sworn off eating fish, a horrifying Angler Fish, a bale of sea turtles, and a forest of jellyfish. All of this just to track down his son. That's what I call being a good dad! Finding Nemo is the perfect mixture of a great story, witty comedy, and enticing animation. The bright colors of the underwater world are extravagant. The dialogue keeps viewers entertained and laughing. While the depth of the story of a father losing his son hooks them in for good. This tale is fit for all, young and old. When a child sits down to watch this movie, they can relate to Nemo. A young child looking to do his own thing and go on some adventures. Nemo grows along the course of the film. He goes from being a rebellious little punk, to someone who understands the importance of family and how much his father loves him. As Nemo grows, any child who watches him grows as well. This is one of many reasons why this is a fantastic movie for children. As Pixar will continue to reel in fantastic stories every year, Finding Nemo will go down as one of their greatest hits. Children and parents are flocking to this new spectacle. This thrilling tale will warm the hearts of fathers everywhere who care for their children. Although Marlin could be a little extreme at times, it was very clear that he would do anything for his Son. I believe I echo the words of everyone saying that we want more from Pixar.",positive
15,"Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters. Along the way, we are given the treat of having some amazing comedy bits as characters cultures clash amongst one another. But even as we travel across the ocean and back, the core of the story never leaves us, it's a love story about a father and son and it is an emotional roller-coaster. They brilliantly take the most notorious fish movie, Jaws (which made the ocean seem terrifying), and turns it upside down, making the water now seem like a wonderful land full of amazing creatures. Finding Nemo is the epitome of Pixar's imagination and creative abilities, they have made an eternal classic here.Let's hope the sequel lives up to the first film!",positive

17,"When I grew up, I always thought the concept of Pixar movies was ""what would life be like as a ____"" Toys were fun, Monsters in the cupboard were fun, bugs were fun, and now we landed on fish. And I loved it because it was colourful and funny and touching.Now, watching Finding Nemo with all I know about film, I am able to understand how brilliant early Pixar was. Every one of these early films has two ""whats life like as"" - one for kids (toys, bugs, monsters) and one for adults. In Finding Nemo, its ""what life is like as an overprotective parent."" Finding Nemo is one of the most beautiful stories that can appeal to families that I've ever seen.The film opens with one of the most downright upsetting moments I ever watched as a child. Albert Brooks' perfect voice casting really captures the grief and desperation that Marlin feels, and it so perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the film. Every one of Marlin's overprotective scenes is not completely justified, but so believable to come from him. We also enjoy Ellen DeGeneres' delightful sidekick Dory, who is absolutely hilarious and charming and I could not love her presence more. As Marlin and Dory set out on the titular quest, Pixar does what Pixar does best - gives us a funny and wondrous understanding of their universe. A gang of sharks are recovering addicts from fish flesh. Seagulls are sadistic and brainless. A group of sea turtles are perpetually high. Throughout each of the encounters, not only does Marlin learn more about the ocean he has been afraid of for so long, but he learns about how his overprotective parenting isn't going to help Nemo forever, and he's better off learning to take care of himself wherever he can.Meanwhile, Nemo is confined in a dentist's tank with a gaggle of kooky fish characters, each of whom has their own little ticks because of their confinement (a beautiful little addition to the story). Emmy king and queen Brad Garrett and Allison Janney are hilarious and even funnier is the addition of Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush, who pops in as a Pelican taking an interest in dental hygiene. The film's story is so perfectly constructed that I can't fault it. The catalyst moments are spread out by moments of character development and sprinkled with perfect doses of humour. Even the final challenge doesn't come across as ""just one more obstacle"" but provides closure on Marlin's overparenting and provides his first real test. Thomas Newman's serene score keeps things moving along at a beautiful pace, and the animation is as superb as anything we've come to expect from Pixar.Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple. Its a lesson to kids and parents alike, but its also so colourful and funny that its a fun watch just when you're feeling flat. Perfect for all occasions.",positive
18,"Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.The plot follows a clown fish named Marlin, that after his son is taken by a human, sets out on a dangerous and treacherous journey to get him back. Along the way he will meet Dory, a blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Together they will stop at nothing to get to Nemo, Marlin's son, who along with a group of ragtag aquarium fish will also plan to escape to the ocean in order to avoid a bratty, but, deadly child and get back to his dad.So like I said, there 3 reasons why I love this movie. The first one is the comedy, provided mostly by the goofy sidekick Dory, as well as other characters. The combination of the smart script, plus the voice talent involved makes for the great comedic side of Finding Nemo. The other great quality of the script, is the emotional turmoil that ensues in the movie, and personally I believe that some parents might resonate with it most, even though I myself do not know this reality. Finally Pixar proves why they are the top of the animation game, by assembling the proper research and creating a great oceanic world, as well as the Sydney landscape.Finding Nemo will forever be a cinematic mark in my cinematic history. It is a funny, energetic and entertaining picture, and that is all I can ask from a movie like this. Rating: 10/10",positive
19,"Finding Nemo is the heroic tale of fishes, and it's excellent. It opens up with a tragedy and quickly leads us to a great adventure and multiple acts of courage. Who would have thought that such a simple idea could result in such a great production?The animation is extremely colorful, brought to us in great details for a breathtaking look at the life under the sea. The dialogs are funny. The script is very inventive and doesn't call on evil or songs. The story is riveting, with each scene a novelty in itself. Voices are chosen to perfection, and the reactions realistic.A great movie for both adults and kids.",positive
20,"Finding Nemo is one of a series of Pixar animation features made in past decade or so and is probably the best of the lot. My three year old watches the DVD at least twice a week and doesn't show any sign of getting tired. The reason is obvious - Finding Nemo creates a complete under the sea world inhabited by creatures with complete personalities.The plot has Marlin, a clown fish, losing his only child Nemo (named after Capt.Nemo of 20,000 leagues under the the sea) to a deep sea diver. While Nemo is stuck in a fish tank in a dental office with lots of other interesting characters, Marlin sets out to find his son. On the way, a crazy blue fish called Dory joins him and turns this into something of a buddy movie (although Dory is female)......There are lots of jokes peppered throughout the movie with Dory supplying a large chunk of them. Writer-director Stanton plays a 'dude' 150 year old sea turtle straight from the 60's and adds to the fun. The visuals are superb, storyline is great and it all makes for a great adventure. I rate this 9/10 because I'm a little sick and tired of seeing it on the DVD every weekend for over a year now!!",positive
21,"There is nothing I can say about the movie that has never been told before. The music was great, the voices were great, the scenario and direction was magnificent. A fascinating story, made by the creators of masterpieces, Pixar...If I could, I would talk about this movie forever, or until I run out of words and adjectives. The story is funny and touching when it's necessary. It made me laugh out loud and even cry for a second. Fantastic. A must-see! Excellent work by the musicians and the director. That's just it. If I go on, I will get on your nerves as I am extremely enthusiastic about this movie. THE movie, actually.",positive
22,"Finding Nemo is a very good animated film, probably it's in the top 10 animated features of all time. The story is about a little clown fish named Nemo. He ventures out into the open sea while not listening to his father. He gets captured by a dentist and now his father, marlin has to save him from the clutches of the dentist and his ""evil"" niece. The story of the film is unbelievable. I don't know how a movie about a fish can be very popular. The voice acting is pretty good. The all-star cast did a great job voicing their characters. The music in this film is sweet. The music will lure you more into the movie. The song in the film is great for people who like music 40 years ago. Once again, Pixar did not fail in its ability to make classic animated films. Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.",positive

This movie has a great story line, and will keep you anxious based on the characters. I will have to say that ""DORI"" played by the wonderful Ellen DeGeneres would be my favorite character in the whole movie. I love how comedic she is. She is clumsy, forgetful, and well you will just have to watch the movie to really she how funny she is. This movie is perfect for all ages, I'm 19 and I still watch it. I can't tell you how excited I am for the movie ""Finding Dori""to come out. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely a 10/10.",positive
26,"Pixar makes the best animated films and Finding Nemo is one more jewel in their crown. Like most Pixar movies, Finding Nemo too deals with universal themes آ– parenting, father-son relationship & friendship. With his crisp, funny & sometimes thought-provoking dialogues, director Andrew Stanton takes you on an adventure ride under the rich and colorful sea full of interesting creatures. This movie is so engrossing that you sometimes forget it is just an animation, especially when you see animated characters display genuine human emotions. Dory is the most unforgettable character I've come across in animated movies. Other characters too remain etched in your memory long after you've seen the movie. This movie certainly deserves a spot among the top movies of this century.",positive
27,"God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their ""secret"". No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. ""Finding Nemo"" is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best.",positive
28,"Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.",positive
29,"There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks). As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.Visually, ""Finding Nemo"" is stunning. Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.In terms of humor, ""Nemo"" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling. It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.The main plot line--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors. Though nothing may ever quite top ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"" belongs on that ""1-B"" slot right along with ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"".",positive
30,"I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me.First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.Most importantly though is the story. Nemo's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.",positive
31,"Finding Nemo may be my favorite Pixar movie. I've first seen it as a kid in 2003, and I instantly got obsessed with it and I've watched it numerous times.Finding Nemo is about a clownfish named Marlin and his son Nemo living in the ocean. Nemo is then captured by us humans, and Marlin is desperate to find his son, who is ""imprisoned"" in an aquarium in a dental clinic in Australia.The characters are perfectly voiced by Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould. Ellen is also charming as the voice of the hilarious Blue Hippo Tang with short-term memory loss named Dory. The movie is animated beautifully with a moving soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman.Finding Nemo is an unforgettable film that will still capture the hearts of many in the years to come.",positive
32,"An overprotective father attempts to find his kidnapped son, all the while learning about what it means to have a real relationship built on trust and mutual understanding.This movie feels perfect still today. No line or moment feels wasted. The film is perfectly entertaining. Every character feels real, fleshed out, and developed. For a movie about talking fish, it is surprising grounded in real human experiences and emotions.I would be hard pressed to find someone who would actively dislike this movie. It is a film that captures the complexities, joys, and sorrows of being human in a way that speaks to adults and children.",positive

38,"Finding Nemo is the compelling story of a fish taken by divers, and his dad searches the entire ocean looking for his son. This movie it great for all ages. A 4 years old and an 84 year old will be entertained by he touching story of this movie. It is here kids learn it is okay to accept help, the ones who truly love you will never give up on you, and just keep swimming, no matter what never give up. I give this movie two thumbs up and would recommend it to anybody. This movie is a Disney classic. I have nothing bad to say about it. The animation is astounding for the time the movie came out. As a result of this movie kids all over the world go to aquariums looking to find Nemo and Dory. Maybe they will find a 100 year old sea turtle as well. This movie is not only entertaining but education as well. This move is unforgettable.",positive
39,"Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.Andrew Stanton plays the viewer like a fiddle, and it's a privilege to be played. Its animation is truly stunning, awash (pun intended) in a dazzling array of colors and creating the impression of a living, breathing sea. Every moment is magnificently orchestrated to tease a response from us - anything from awe to aw-shucks. Yes, it's a visual feast, but more importantly it's an epic journey filled with adventure and discovery that encompasses the grandest sweep of the ocean's vastness and the tiniest longing of the heart. While preserving the characters' intrinsic ""fishy-ness"", the silver- tongued voice cast offers great supplementary texture to a marvelous sensory experience. While Brooks is amusing as the ever fretful Marlin, it is DeGeneres who gives a bravura comic performance as the guileless but whacked-out Dory. Ceaselessly forgetful, her endearing Dory makes a difficult traveling companion but a scintillating friend â€“ Dory is a complete hoot.Instead of rising to a challenge, Finding Nemo plunges into it and comes up a winner. All in all, a buoyant adventure that manages to evoke the quicksilver trait of the ocean without necessarily feeling 'wet'!",positive
40,"It's so fun and enjoyable and greatly written with an excellent story line. The actors were superb, we felt a mix of emotions through the viewing. Definitely a movie for all ages. We can tell that the producers of this film worked hard to bring to life the under water world in such an engaging and comedic way, and the quality of animation, captivating bright colours and suited cinematography, as expected was fantastic which we felt also aided the entire viewer experience. With each character's unique personality being perfectly distinguished in a clever way highlighted much creativity and places this particular movie at the top of the our list of awesomely produced animated films. If you haven't seen this film we encourage you to do so and be prepared for an experience and be taken into another world. Do watch and thoroughly enjoy! A great ""must see""!",positive
41,"This must be the best kids movie of all time.Funny and heart-warming, it'll leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Beautifully made. Expertly animated. Very well written Superbly acted. I have seen this several times and notice new stuff every time. Ellen DeGeneres is fabulous. Far superior to the likes of Shark Tale. Ten lines is a lot to expect in a review about a film, you don't think that ten lines is an awful lot until you start to write a review for a film and then you actually realise that ten lines is actually a lot of lines to write and repeat yourself. I have tried not to repeat myself but not really very hard. Perhaps if I was to try harder not to repeat myself then the task of not repeating would be easier but as the situation stands at the moment, I fear that I might be repeating myself, perhaps I could go swimming in the sea or in a swimming pool or a lake or loch or a big puddle.",positive
42,"I have to admit it... I am hooked on animations. Did you get it? :)OK. This is another proof that animations are for all ages and if the story is good and it has a moral that relates to all of us, it's a success.Really well done. Great voice acting. Fluid animation and cute characters that are alive.Loved it! Watched it several times... and every time you discover something new...Try to catch the pelican saying ""nice"" with an Australian accent and flying way... did you get the reason? Hilarious. Smooth humour.All together: Beautiful!",positive
43,"There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.",positive
44,"This is one of my favorite Pixar movies! I could sit and watch this movie all day. It's one of those movies that will never get old. To this day, I still cry when Nemo's mom dies. I find this movie to be not only family-friendly, but age appropriate. Anybody of any age can sit down and watch this movie. The variety of ocean life that they use is great for young children because it teaches them what animals live in the ocean. It's one of those movies that's perfect for family movie night or just simply at a sleepover. When I was in high school, my government teacher gave us a movie day and this was the movie of choice. Everybody in the class was so excited and nobody complained. I highly recommend this movie, especially with younger children. You're never too old or too young to watch Nemo.",positive
45,"A breath-taking movie. Pixar had created a wonderful world through animation. A real treat for our eyes. Great story. Great comedy. Great action. Great adventure. Great world. Great characters. Great ride. My favorite, the fish Dora.It's about a father fish trying to get back his son fish who had been kidnapped by humans to Sydney. He travels all over the ocean to get his son back no matter what it cost him. An amazing movie about a father's love for his son.All praise goes to the creators. They have done an amazing job. Capital ""A""mazing. The animation water-world and fishes looks so realistic in nature. One of major plus point for Pixar Studios. They are real artist. Their hard work had really paid off.It's no surprise for this movie to be awarded the Best animated movie of the year.",positive
46,"I've seen this movie at least twice, parts of it four or five times...the humor resonates on all levels (not just age levels, but visual versus audio, double indentures. etc, and reflects realities of modern industrial family and existential experience; it's a simple but great story line (although, much of the entertainment is in a series of vignettes; characters you (well, sort of) care about; spectacular animation. The casting of actors doing the voices is about as good as it gets. One of the amazing things for me in watching this movie a second and third time was the subtleties in the facial expressions and these animated characters. I highly recommend this movie - even for people (such as myself) who don't normally care for animated films.",positive
47,"possibly the second best animated movie of all time (first being Aladdin) and it is definitely the funniest!! the story was great, and the jokes are unforgettable. props to whoever played dory, because that was the FUNNIEST talking fish i have ever seen in my life. the fish in tanks were cute, and the turtles were cool. i liked the sharks, and the way nemo's name was constantly mispronounced (fabio, etc.) i wouldn't necessarily recommend it for really little kids, as it was a little sad. but overall, i absolutely loved it. i hope they come up with some sort of sequel that doesn't absolutely ruin it, but even if they don't , it's still an absolutely awesome movie.",positive
48,"Pixar Studios is one of the world's most exciting and cool film studios. They deliver every single time for the whole family; fun, dramatic, brilliance, entertainment, moral...everything! Before this instalment Pixar has given us TOY STORY 1/2, A BUG'S LIFE and MONSTERS INC. that's all extremely good films! This, last one, FINDING NEMO is just as jolly good!
We follow Marlin, a clown-fish that's on a desperat look for his only child, Nemo, that as said before is the only survivor after their family was brutally attacked by a barracuda and almost everybody were eaten. Marlin hooks up with another fish that shows herself to have extremely bad memory and forgets thing almost before she's get to know them! Now, these two goes on the search of Nemo, who's lost in the big blue ocean, where there are sharks, bombs, whales, birds and much more!The story is this time probably the best detail, off course together with the humour that is also brilliant fun! It is packed with funny scenes and the animation is getting more and more stunning, the dialogs are brilliant, everything works as good as it gets! Dozens of genius characters are packed into this story. It is a very choosy movie and it keeps up it's entertainment in a very fine way, the only thing that's something to put anything on is the end, that's really nothing. But the rest of the movie is pure entertainment and is very, very nice watching! FINDING NEMO's got entire scenes. Like the one with the three sharks that has decided to form a club where they have to promise that they shall not eat other fishes, cause that's cannibalism. Either it's small characters or big, they're all over the place! You laugh a lot, and if it isn't funny, it's just so entertaining or nice made that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. As the movie goes by you feel a small piece of boring in the middle, but FINDING NEMO fixes it with smacking some more characters and keeping the tempo up and keeping the paralell - story interesting with Nemo actually being caught in a aquarium together with other fishes.STARS: 5/5",positive
49,"Just saw Finding Nemo this morning (Satyam Cineplex, Chennai, India) one word to comment - 'breathtaking CG work' the entire voice talent team has done a gr8 job too!The colorful coral of the Marlins, the forgetful Dory, the 'Fish are our friends, not Food' Sharks, the mighty Whale, 150 yrs old. Crush - the Turtle and its kiddies in the EAC, the tank and Nemos' Mates at the Dentist's place, they are all too good!!Toy Story, Antz, Shrek ...and now Finding Nemo! lol forgot Darla at the Dentist..

I'm exaggerating but It's really great and I think everybody will like it.All the characters are very funny,even the ""bad guys"" are kind of nice.My personal favourites are the sharks!They were so funny! So,everybody watch this film,you're gonna love it!!!",positive
51,"Finding Nemo has it all...fantastic animation, great story, hilarious comedy, and wonderful voice acting. Ellen, I wish the Academy would create a Best Voice Acting Category and give you the first award. Your work as Dory stole the show.This is one of the few movies I can pull out and watch at any time. Pixar has not won Best Animated Feature yet, and of their body of films, this is the perfect picture to give them their first.",positive
52,"This is a great movie, and i don't see how anyone can say differently. Pixar has once again made magic using cg. I swear sometimes it is hard to see the difference between computer animations and real film. I find that especially the ocean is masterfully done. If you haven't already seen this movie, go see it now!",positive
53,"`Finding Nemo' is one of the best, perhaps THE best, animated films ever made آ– in a class with the Disney masterpieces, `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' `Pinocchio,' and `Bambi.'  It is gorgeous to look at, exciting, funny آ– often very funny آ– and moving. `Finding Nemo' is a great film, 10 out of 10.",positive
54,"Yeah, like what the title of the comment says... I just like the movie just a little bit less than Shrek (who can forget: CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS OVER A PINT?) but I laughed more than during the times I watched Shrek. It's -to my honest opinion- a lot funnier than Ice Age. And the story is beautifully realized, without overdoing it, like Disney sometimes does.
And eeeeeeuuuuuuh... I SPEAK WHALE!!!",positive
55,"This is truly the best animated film ever. It is pure Disney magic. In my opinion it was the best film of the summer of 2003. It also has to be the funniest Disney movie ever made. I hope there is a sequel to this. The only problem is what they are going to call it. They'll have to call it something else unless they're finding Nemo again. Anyway, getting back to this movie, I thought that the absent-minded fish Dori was the funniest character. I also thought those Seagulls that always said ""Mine"" was funny. For some reason when I first saw the movie I thought those Gulls were saying ""Mike"". Then I realized that they couldn't say ""Mike"" because it wouldn't make sense. 10/10. I always love it when Disney and Pixar work together.",positive
56,"I think its very funny that you people who are insulting Finding Nemo are insulting a G rated, kids movie. Finding Nemo is a very sweet movie and its really cute. I have many younger cousins who are 2 all the way to 12 who really enjoyed this movie and talk about it all the time. So I think its hilarious that adults are coming on this board and ragging on the movie about how stupid it is. And yes, I am aware that G means general audience but G usually means its great for kids. But, yes, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Think about how its for younger audiences before you go on about insulting it. Well I'm going to watch it with my 10 year old brother. Bye!",positive
57,"This is a fantastic film no matter how old you are. The storyline is good and the graphics are amazing. I am a big fan of Disney and Pixar, but this film, compared to Toy Story and Shrek, is so much better. It's a great family film that will have you upset, excited but most of all it will have you laughing so much all the way through! The best character has got to be Dory because she is just hilarious!",positive
58,"Quite why I haven't commented on this before is beyond me, but still, here I amPut simply, Finding Nemo is a brilliant film with funny and endearing characters that are a joy to watch. Pixar have again pushed the boundaries of computer animation to bring us a realistic yet still cartoonish film that will appeal to anyone from 3 to 103. I'm sure most people's favourite bit was the whale speak by Dory, which had me in stitches. However other little incidents in the film really made me laugh so much. When the little baby fish falls off the sponge bed is so typical of how children react when they hurt themselves. The animators and writers at Pixar really know how to capture the way people react to situations. All the little facial expressions throughout the film are beautifully animated.The water effects must have been tremendously difficult to achieve, but they are fantastic. The lighting changes that were required really help set the mood of a scene, even when Marlin and Dory were inside the whale. The story although basic was successfully pulled off with no dip in any of the action. The story kept going when it shifted between Marlin's desperate attempt to locate his son, and Nemo's dispair of being alone with no one to look after him except the new collection of strange friends in the dentist fish tank.
Overall I give it 10/10 because it was great. I can't wait for The Incredibles next year, I'm sure it will be just as good.",positive
59,"A spectacle in every way, this film is guaranteed to delight viewers of all ages. An instant classic, and an example of cinema at its most spellbinding. The animation is cutting edge, the jokes fly thick and fast, there's not too much maudlin sentiment to weigh one down, and the musical score is among the best I've heard in recent years. Flawless!",positive
60,"Pixar has done it again, it seems that whenever Pixar and Disney come out with a movie it is always a tremendous success, and Finding Nemo is no exception. This is the best Pixar film yet and it will be tough to beat. The visual effects are amazing; everything in this Pixar ocean looks so real, from the sand to the sunlight hitting the water. You almost feel like you're underwater and it's hard to imagine that this is animation is not real. The voice work just adds to the animation and makes the movie that much better. Hands down, Ellen DeGeneres is the best in this movie; her voice work as Dory is just hilarious. Every scene that Dory is in I couldn't help but laugh, and with help from the script, the film has some of the funniest scenes in a children's movie. This movie is perfect for kids as it will amuse and entertain them or whoever else may be watching with them. The animation literally comes alive, the humor is everywhere and this all makes Finding Nemo a movie that is extremely enjoyable to watch.",positive
61,"With Finding Nemo (which has just been released in cinema's today here in the Netherlands) Pixar once again delivers a true masterpiece, easily the best of their films so far, and maybe even the best animation I've seen (and that long list includes Shrek and The Lion King).All one hopes for is provided: stunning images, lovely music (by Thomas Newman, always a firm favourite), a great story with humour, humanity and warmth, great voice performances... Simply perfect.When the words ""The End"" appeared, the entire cinema was sorry (sighs all around) - that says enough now doesn't it... :-)If you're not one of those ""I only like it when it's noisy and violent"" kind of persons, you'll probably love this film over and over again. Be sure to watch the entire ending titles too as there are some little surprises in it... right until the end.",positive
62,"I bought this movie on a Vcd when i went on a holiday to Singapore in 2004.Everything about this is fantastic..Photography is amazing.Colors are amazing.Characters are great.Dialogs are wonderful.Story is great.It tells about 2 fishes Marlin and his child Nemo.One day Nemo is taken away.Marlin meets Dory.They go to help to find him.They go to a doctors clinic and see Nemo he is being sent away to a little girl who is destructive.But in the they save Nemo.The acting is brilliant from the characters.Casting was perfect.Voices were great.i know some hated this by calling it a lot of harsh words like Pathetic,Terrible,Waste etc.Forget them this is an awesome movie",positive
63,"Finding Nemo is honestly one of the few films I count as perfect. From the absolutely stunning animation, a beautiful story, breathe-taking visuals, and some memorable characters (protagonists and side characters alike), this film is just top notch. Watching this as an adult (I watched this so much as a kid) it still holds up extremely well and it's charm still shines bright. Some of Pixar's best work.",positive
64,"4 Stars: With a sense of imagination that only a child could have, Pixar has finally struck gold. En route to becoming the highest grossing animated movie in history, and deservedly so, Finding Nemo is a real gem for both kids and their parents. Its first move in the right direction is setting the picture underwater. Amid a previously unseen and pleasantly quirky world of spaced-out sea turtles and 12-step program sharks, the movie presents a heartwarming story about a father's search for his son. Add in witty dialogue and extroadinary performances by both Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks and you got a movie that's too good to miss.",positive
65,"As a kid born in 1998, Finding Nemo was one of the first movies I ever saw in theaters. I know it's not the first, but I cannot remember one prior.Finding Nemo made me fall in love with cinema. I watched it as a small kid, watched it several times since and it still manages to make me feel exactly what it set out to make me feel.To me, this movie is not only a perfectly well written example of what an animated film should be like, it's a masterclass in storytelling, engaging audiences through plots and subplots, perfectly tied by humor, voice acting and and computer animation, which still stands to date (2024).Finding Nemo is a MUST WATCH for every family wanting their kids to find love for filmography.",positive
66,"I'm 27 years old and I have a 9 year old daughter.  For some strange reason, she didn't want to see Finding Nemo when it came to the theaters, so i said cool, i'll just buy the dvd when it comes out.....big mistake.  I should have listened to my daughter. She hated it along with my 2 nieces, ages 3 & 4, and my nephew, age 5.  The animation was beautiful but the story was.....well.....just BORING.  About 30 minutes into the movie, they were ready to watch something else and frankly, so was I.",negative
67,"Honestly, I do not understand why so many people love this movie. I can normally watch a disney movie and enjoy myself, but this one simply did not entertain me. First of all, I noticed in Finding Nemo was that there were not any songs. most disney movies have parts where the charectors break into song, not in Finding Nemo. Secondly, I found some of the charectors quite annoying, especially the blue fish. Lastly, the worse thing about Finding Nemo is that so many people talk like it was the best kids movie ever made. Because of this i was expecting another entertaining, fun, and enjoyable kids movie, but instead i wasted an hour and a half of my life.",negative
68,"After the over-the-top praise this movie received, I was surprised to find it to be an pretty unremarkable movie, and one that's not especially imaginative/visual. It is uncomplicated by any element not approved by committee, which means you get regurgitated under-sea relationships, with slightly modernized shtick. (Yep, there's a shark chase, but he's in recovery ?!) Take any three familiar mass market plot lines and average them together and you get something as tepid as this. This movie was gone from my mind the second it ended. I don't recall a frame of it.The only way you could be a fan of this movie is if you think a movie is supposed to spell everything out for you and cause you to emote every twenty minutes. It never touched me and it never engaged me. Nobody ever went broke tossing look-alike projects at undiscerning American audiences.",negative
69,"Toy Story again, but with fishes.1 idea, 2 movies..... I'm getting really sick of this - GO TAKE A CREATIVE WRITING CLASS, YOU IDIOTS!Yes, but some truly *amazing* visuals, as always - there must be *something* there to make you part with your hard-earned. (and some parts of that something, for some reason, look very much like a screensaver common in Win98 days that I saw here and there... ??!!!! Maybe Pixar look for their inspiration in more mundane (and obvious!) places than I thought?.... :) )Enjoy on TV, friends places and the like. DON'T PART, etc., etc.,....",negative
70,"Talk about two of the most irritating characters Pixar has ever created. The overbearing mother Ming and her overly dramatic daughter Mei, made this film extremely difficult to watch. Both characters were beyond insufferable! Pixar is completely losing its touch! This is the 3rd film in a row they make, that I would not want to watch more than once.",negative
71,"As a Chinese American I have to say that I'm very disappointed by this movie. Seriously what is the movie trying to teach the kids? To be youself and don't listen to your parnets at the age of 13? Or to sneak out of the house at the middle of the night? Or go to a not child appropriate concert without parents permission? The main characters are teens, they are at the very age that can be easily misled by these wrong messages. This is the most irresponsible movie that Pixar has made.",negative
72,"This film has a decent premise. But the plot and characters feel very cliche and boring, with the main theme being a good message but poorly portrayed.The art style is HORRIBLE. The character models look like some cheap bowling alley screen display characters.This film lacks Disney Pixars magic. What happened to the creativity of Monsters Inc, Up, Coco?",negative
73,"As a parent of 4. This movie is not for kids especially under the age of 8. It teaches you that it's ok to go behind your parents back and do things you shouldn't be doing. Teaches you betrayal. Teaches you that your friends are more important then family. Teaches you it's ok to lie. Teaches you it's ok to hide secrets from your parents.

Disney what are you doing?!?!?",negative
74,Straight out the gate this movie not appropriate for all ages and those involved should be ashamed for not giving prior warnings to parents. I have no idea what movie those scoring this highly were watching but it's certainly not the movie I watched.The main character is extremely arrogant and just not relatable or likeable and the mother is so far beyond controlling that she's a borderline psychopath and of course the father is just some overweight dude there for appearances.I've no idea what message this sends to kids but it's not that puberty is natural and part of life but that it's a bizarre rollercoaster and you can pretty much do anything you want when experiencing it.,negative
75,"I'm a 22 year old female who desires to become a teacher and was disappointed, to say the least, in the message behind this film. Embracing your emotions are important but if your emotions leads you to lie to your parents, listen to your bad influential friends, and care more about the lastest music than caring for other people, then you need to learn not to give into those emotions. It's so sad today to see kids having no respect for their teachers and/or adults who care deeply for them because they've been fed these message that they're allowed to do whatever they want without thinking of the consequences and the effect it has on other people and theirselves later on in life, and wondering when did things starting to go out of hand.""My panda, my choice"" was the response she told her mom when her mom told her that her appearance was inappropriate. It seems innocent but guys, I'm begging you to look at the deeper message. Be careful what you allow your children to watch.",negative
76,The beginning of the movie is a beautiful and cute description of life as a preteen.

Pixar has had some incredible productions throughout its tenure, but could we be witnessing in real time, the decline on the once great film studio?Don't get me wrong, the animation is good and I'm sure this will turn a profit for them. However, the last couple of films (including this one) that they've released have been a bit of a yawn for me.I'm also not sure I liked the message that it was trying to send, or what I perceived as the message anyway.I liked the inclusivity and yes we need more monitory stories to be told, but overall I wasn't a fan of this.",negative

There had to be committees deciding which Pixar movies get made, right, so what group of people sitting around a table thought this was a great Disney/Pixar film? Girls won't like this just because you think you're being relatable by shoving the things girls *don't* want to discuss with strangers, or even family, right on screen where they have to all sit together and pretend it's not uncomfortable. May some people say ""aww, you just have hang-ups""? Maybe, but that's a minority and if they want to make a movie for a small minority - say those that like to host a dinner party and sit down to talk about menstruation and hot dreams, go for it. Otherwise, hopefully lesson learned and they can do better next time.",negative

To show the parents or family in a bad light who care the most about you?! Or to fantasize about boys being mermaids?! Or is it to use your powers to make some money for a concert?! I don't know & i surely don't think that it is to embrace who you truly are! And why do this woke Disney thinks that every 13 year old girl acts & thinks like that?! I have a 13 year old sister & thank god she do not acts like any of those brats & guess what she DID NOT liked the movie either.Tell me Disney if I agree with her mom (for the most part until they intentionally tried to show that she's a big evil monster!) does that make me look bad or am I not included in your woke people's list? Lmao.. Never felt more annoyed after watching a kids movie. Just wake up ""woke"" disney & stop brainwashing kids by making them watch your woke trash.Note to myself: Be aware at what your kid watches in the name of animation from now on.Easily skippable (as it also does not have a proper plot & is predictable too).

I would HATE to have to answer all the questions from my young boys about what in the world the mother is talking about. I would also hate to tell my daughter about this life fact because it was introduced to her, too young, in this movie.Also, and more importantly, Mei-Mei is a horrible example. Encouraging kids to disobey and lie to parents because they won't understand them.

I really haven't seen anything capturing since...oh it has been awhile.Turns into a Red Panda when she's emotional...wow what a concept.No wonder this came out on Disney + and not in theaters. It's terrible.Give the next film graduate $3 million and I can bet you 100% they'd turn out something far better than this junk.Pixar used to be the best in the industry! The absolute best! Now we get this. And all ""critics"" are raving about it because if you don't you might get canceled. No sorry. A movie that is terrible needs to realize it's terrible.

Me, being the mother I am and trusting Pixar, let my daughter start the movie while I was cooking.Much to my surprise when I walked out I saw scenes where the daughter was hiding under her bed, sweating and drawing ""sexy"" photos of her and a boy. It was soooooo uncomfortable. I decided to fast forward a bit and give it a chance. Even after that there were many, many things that were obviously meant for kids age 13 and older.Unfortunately it left my 7 year old with a slew of questions I was NOT ready to answer and topics I didn't want to bring up till a later age.It's weird being in a position now where I feel like I need to screen a movie geared towards little kids, and Pixar at that, before I let my kid watch it.

I wouldn't want my son or daughter to behave that way or be influenced by this movie. My kids love red pandas so I thought I would check this movie out with them.
